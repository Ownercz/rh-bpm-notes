Human Tasks
===========

## Properties
Syntax to add variables in **subject** or **description**

E.g.

    Escalation for Artwork Processing #{defaultDataInput}

In a multi instance loop the human task description can access to the instance data: ``#{miDataInputX}``

## Authentication

Users are listed in the following file:

    <EAP_HOME>/standalone/configuration/application-users.properties

Roles are defined in the following file:

    <EAP_HOME>/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties


### Default Users information

The default implementation [DefaultUserInfo](https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/6.5.x/jbpm-human-task/jbpm-human-task-core/src/main/java/org/jbpm/services/task/identity/DefaultUserInfo.java) reads the configuration from:

    EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/classes/userinfo.properties

Example content:

    Luke\ Cage=luke@domain.com:en-UK:luke

It can be changed in `EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/beans.xml`


## ActorId

Add as input parameter of the HT
You can leverage the initiator variable:

 - declare `initiator` as `String`

## Due date

It's possible to specify a `DueDate` as parameter following ISO standard duration format.

Examples:

 - `P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S` represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds".
 - `P2D` represents 2 days

[Wikipedia duration standard format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations)

## Swim lane assignment

The second task in the swim lane is assigned to the same user that performed the previous task.

[AbstractHTWorkItemHandler AutoClaim](https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/6.5.x/jbpm-human-task/jbpm-human-task-workitems/src/main/java/org/jbpm/services/task/wih/AbstractHTWorkItemHandler.java#L218)

When you use JAAS Identity Provider, auto claim does not work if the previous task was out of the swimlane (it was performed by another user): in the log you'll find a permission error:

    WARN  [org.jbpm.services.task.wih.LocalHTWorkItemHandler] (default task-22 ) User ... is not allowed to auto claim task due to permission violation

This is caused by the fact that JAASUserGroupCallbackImpl can retrieve groups just for a logged user.
This usually is not a problem in a production environment where you rely on other identity providers (e.g. LDAP).
To test the capability in a test environment there are 2 possible workarounds:

1. Using MVEL identity provider.

    - In Business central you have to edit CDI config `<EAP_HOME>/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/beans.xml`

            <alternatives>
                <class>org.jbpm.services.cdi.producer.DefaultUserGroupInfoProducer</class>
            </alternatives>
            
    - In kieserver, add this system property:

            <property name="org.jbpm.ht.callback" value="mvel"/>

    - then add this file `<runtime_war>/WEB-INF/classes/org/jbpm/services/task/identity/UserGroupsAssignmentsOne.mvel`

            usersgroups = [
                    new User('donato') : [new Group( "developer" ), new Group( "manager" ), new Group( "Administrators" )],
                    new User('supplier1') : [new Group( "user" ), new Group( "supplier" )],
                    new User('supplier2') : [new Group( "user" ), new Group( "supplier" )],
                    new User('supplier3') : [new Group( "user" ), new Group( "supplier" )],
                  ];
            return usersgroups;

2. Change the process to set the `Actors` to `#{SwimlaneActorId}` for all the Human Task that follow the first one in the swim lane.

3. Properties

```
org.jbpm.ht.callback = props
jbpm.user.info.properties=classpath:/userinfo.properties
```

Constructs default UserInfo implementation to provide required information to the escalation handler.
following is the string for every organizational entity
entityId=email:locale:displayname:[member,member]
members are optional and should be given for group entities


Example:

```
john=john@domain.com:en-UK:john
mary=mary@domain.com:en-UK:mary
krisv=krisv@domain.com:en-UK:krisv
admin=admin@domain.com:en-UK:admin

Crusaders=Crusaders@domain.com:en-UK:Crusaders:[Luke Cage,Bobba Fet,Tony Stark]
Knights\ Templer=Crusaders@domain.com:en-UK:ACrusaders:[Bobba Fet]
Wrong\ Crusaders=WrongCrusaders@domain.com:en-UK:Wrong Crusaders:[Darth Vader]
Nobodies=nobodies@domain.com:en-UK:Nobodies:[]
```







## Assignment Rules

Assignment rules are rules executed automatically when a Human Task is created or completed. This mechanism can be used, for example, to assign a Human Task automatically to a particular user of a group or prevent a user from completing a Task if data is missing.

Create a file that will contain the rule definition on the Business Central classpath (the recommended location is DEPLOY_DIR/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/classes/):

default-add-task.drl with the rules to be checked when the Human Task is created
default-complete-task.drl with the rules to be checked when the Human Task is completed

[TaskServiceRequest](https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-human-task/jbpm-human-task-core/src/main/java/org/jbpm/services/task/rule/TaskServiceRequest.java)



## Special Roles

The user `Administrator` and all users in the group `Administrators`, can see and manage all the task. (This name can be configure through these system properties: `org.jbpm.ht.admin.user`, `org.jbpm.ht.admin.group`.

In order to define a specific administration group for a task, the developer has to define either `BusinessAdministratorId` or `BusinessAdministratorGroupId` as task input parameter.

If a task define the `ExcludedOwnerId`, this user is removed by the potential owner list.

## Notifications

Tech note on how to define a custom notification listener:
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/885393

This is the interface, where you have many information about the task the passed the deadline:
https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-human-task/jbpm-human-task-core/src/main/java/org/jbpm/services/task/deadlines/NotificationListener.java

A possible library to implement HTML templates:

https://freemarker.apache.org/

## 4 eye principle

And why not to rely on potential owners and excluded owners that come with WS-HT spec that we do have support for?

the first task that is completed returns `ActorId` data output that represents the actual onwer who completed the task, then map this to variable and use on next task as excluded owner (via data input mapping, parameter name: `ExcludedOwnerId`) so when you query for tasks (via task service queries that take into consideration excluded owners) you won’t see that task and thus won’t be able to work on it.

It cannot implemented to a couple of issues.

## Notification Email

### Variable available in the template

- processInstanceId
- processSessionId
- workItemId
- expirationTime
- taskId
- `doc` is an HashMap with the Task Input Parameters
